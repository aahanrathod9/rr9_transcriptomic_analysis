# rr9_transcriptomic_analysis
This repo analyzes NASA OSD-255 mouse retina RNA-Seq data to identify gene signatures correlated with spaceflight-induced oxidative stress (HNE) and apoptosis (TUNEL). It uses machine learning models to link gene expression to phenotypic damage, resulting in key gene lists for MSigDB analysis (Tables 5 &amp; 7).
